## Why?

Sometimes it is nice to build things using pure CSS in order to appreciate the functionalities provided by frameworks and pre-processors such as React, Angular, Vue, Bootstrap, and SASS. I personally use React's Styled components a lot, so it 
is easy to take it for granted.

My goal was to redesign the Twitter UI while implementing as many visual features as possible without using JavaScript, purely utilizing HTML and CSS.

As a bonus, I got to learn how to implement a sticky sidebar without using JavaScript => Spoiler: it was done by using `position: sticky`.
